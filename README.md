# conky_config_files
## Description
Some useful conky config files that I use in my laptop.
I use the GUI "conky-manager" to easily create and edit the config files.
## Considerations
Some printouts are in Spanish, can be edited easily. 
I have an old 2-Core CPU, this can be also easily extended for CPUs with more cores.
